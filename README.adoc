= Space Invaders 2D

A simple Space Invaders sample using OpenGL in modern C++, using SDL2 for cross-platform support

* Uses https://conan.io[conan.io] to obtain and setup libraries
* Uses https://cmake.org[CMake] for build system creation

== Quickstart

Windows:: `auto.bat` #or double-click
Linux:: `./auto.sh`

== Manual start

From a command line, at the root of this project

1. Make a directory for temporary build files
  * `mkdir build`
2. Change into that directory
  * `cd build`
3. Ask conan to install libraries, according to `conanfile.txt`
  * `conan install .. --build missing`
4. Ask CMake to make a build system (build files will be in `build` folder. `.sln` file for Visual Studio)
  * Windows
    ** `cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"`
  * Linux
    ** `cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles`
  * Any (auto select build system)
    ** `cmake ..`
5. Do the build
  * Visual Studio, manually
    ** open the `.sln` file and hit *build*
  * Ask CMake to ask the build system to build (OPTIONAL)
    ** `cmake --build . --config Debug`
6. Return to parent directory
  * `cd ..`
